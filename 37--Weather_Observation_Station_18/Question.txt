Consider P1(a,b) and P2(c,d) to be two points on a 2D plane.

1. a happens to equal the minimum value in Northern Latitude (LAT_N in STATION).
2. b happens to equal the minimum value in Western Longitude (LONG_W in STATION).
3. c happens to equal the maximum value in Northern Latitude (LAT_N in STATION).
4. d happens to equal the maximum value in Western Longitude (LONG_W in STATION).


Query the Manhattan Distance between points P1 and P2 and format your answer to display 4 decimal digits.

Input Format

The STATION table is described as follows:

   		STATION
     +--------------+----------------+
     |   Field      |      Type      |
     +--------------+----------------+
     |	  ID 	    |     NUMBER     |
     |	 CITY	    |    VARCHAR(21) |
     |	 STATE 	    |    VARCHAR(21) |
     |	 LAT_N 	    |     NUMBER     |
     |   LONG_W     |     NUMBER     |
     +--------------+----------------+

where LAT_N is the northern latitude and LONG_W is the western longitude.
